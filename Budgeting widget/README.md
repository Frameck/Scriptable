**INSTRUCTIONS**

This widget is used in combination with a google sheets file to pull data to display on your homescreen using Scriptable

**CODE**

The code has the name of the variables mainly in italian, but it's not that hard to change them if you need to

1) The widget supports both light and dark mode
2) Where there's need to maintain the layout the figures of the thousands are replaced with "k" indicator
3) You can easily change the currency at the beginning of the script

**SETTING THE SCRIPT**

Setting up the script is easy, you just need to replace the **SHEET ID** with your own
On the homescreen of your iPhone you have to add a **Large** Scriptable widget and select the **Budgeting** script
 
**SET UP GOOGLE SHEETS**
1) Make a Google Sheet
2) Publish your Google Sheet, File -> Publish To Web
3) Copy the SHEET_ID in the URL, put it in the url in the script like shown below
4) It's very important to not change the formatting of the cells in google sheets, otherwise the widget will not work
